Cocopi is a flexible file based CMS. Use it to build simple websites and blogs quickly. Cocopi is completely file based but offers the power of PHP in case you need more than just static content.

The Cocopi admin panel is powered by Cockpit, allowing you to add any kind of dynamic content in case you want to move beyond static files.
