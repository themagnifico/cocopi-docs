First steps with Cocopi
===

Trying out Cocopi for the first time? Great! Everyone learns differently, so you might prefer a different order, but here are some first steps we can recommend.

1. Download and [install](installation.md) the [Cocopi Kickstart Package](https://github.com/COCOPi/cocopi-kickstart).
2. Login to the admin area and [create content in the interface](interface.md).
3. Browse the `/content` folder to see how [Content](content.md) is stored in flat files.
4. To understand the `/site` folder and customize your website, read the [Theme section](theme.md) and check out the example on how to [build a Blog](blog.md).
